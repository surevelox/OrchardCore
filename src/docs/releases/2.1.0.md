# Orchard Core 2.1.0

Release date: Not yet released

## Change Logs

### Users  Feature

#### External Authentication Logic Has Been Separated From the Users Feature

We've introduced a new feature called **External Authentication**. This feature has been separated from the existing **Users** feature to improve dependency management and to provide an option to disable external authentication by default. As a result, the **User Registration** feature no longer needs to be enabled unless you specifically want to allow site registration.

This feature is only available on-demand and cannot be manually enabled or disabled. It is automatically enabled when a feature requiring external authentication is activated.

We included a fast-forward migration to enable this feature automatically if previously needed. No action is needed from site administrators.

The following settings have been relocated to new classes as part of this update:

- The properties `UseScriptToSyncRoles` and `SyncRolesScript` have been moved from `LoginSettings` to the new `ExternalLoginSettings` class.
- The property `UseExternalProviderIfOnlyOneDefined` has also been moved from `LoginSettings` to `ExternalLoginSettings`.

In addition, several properties have been moved from `RegistrationSettings` to a new `ExternalRegistrationSettings` class:

- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoPassword`.
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoUsername`.
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.NoEmail`.
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.UseScriptToGenerateUsername`.
- `GenerateUsernameScript` is now `ExternalRegistrationSettings.GenerateUsernameScript`.

Moreover, a new property, `DisableNewRegistrations`, has been added to `ExternalRegistrationSettings`, allowing you to prevent new external users from registering on the site. This property will be set by default if you are currently using the **NoRegistration** value for the obsolete `UsersCanRegister` property.

Also, note the following updates in `ExternalLoginSettings`:

- `UseScriptToSyncRoles` has been renamed to `ExternalLoginSettings.UseScriptToSyncProperties`.
- `SyncRolesScript` has been renamed to `ExternalLoginSettings.SyncPropertiesScript`.

!!! warning
    When updating recipes to configure `LoginSettings` or `RegistrationSettings`, ensure that the settings reflect the new class structure.

### User Registration Feature

#### User Registration Feature No Longer Required for External Authentication

The **User Registration** feature is no longer required if you only want to enable external authentication. 

The following properties of `RegistrationSettings` are now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

- `UsersCanRegister`
- `NoPasswordForExternalUsers`
- `NoUsernameForExternalUsers`
- `NoEmailForExternalUsers`
- `UseScriptToGenerateUsername`
- `GenerateUsernameScript`

Previously, the `UsersCanRegister` property controlled which types of registration were allowed. With this update, this property is obsolete and will be removed in a future release. To enable site registration now, simply activate the **User Registration** feature.

### Roles Feature

#### Roles Assignment Permissions Consolidated

In the Roles feature, there were previously `AssignRoles` and `AssignRole_{RoleName}` permissions, alongside the Users feature's `AssignRoleToUsers` and `AssignRoleToUsers_{RoleName}` permissions. As these permissions were redundant and the `AssignRoles` permissions were never actually authorized against, `AssignRoles` and `AssignRole_{RoleName}` have been removed in favor of the latter.

!!! warning
    Please review all your recipes and replace occurrences of `AssignRoles` with `AssignRoleToUsers`, and `AssignRole_{RoleName}` with `AssignRoleToUsers_{RoleName}`.

### Azure Communication Services Email Feature

#### Azure Communication Services Email Feature Name Update

The feature formerly known as **Azure Email Provider** has been renamed to **Azure Communication Services Email** to clarify that it uses ACS, and to use the same naming pattern as the ACS SMS feature (see above).

Additionally, the configuration provider key for the default provider has changed from `OrchardCore_Email_Azure` to `OrchardCore_Email_AzureCommunicationServices`. While the old key (`OrchardCore_Email_Azure`) will continue to bind for backward compatibility, it is scheduled for removal in the next major release. To ensure future compatibility, it is highly recommended to update your configuration to use the new key.

## Added Features

### Azure Communication Services SMS Feature

A new feature was added to allow you to send SMS messages using Azure Communication Services (ACS). Simply enable it then navigate to the admin dashboard > `Configurations` >> `Settings` >> `SMS` to configure the provider. For more information you can refer to the [docs](../reference/modules/Sms.Azure/README.md).

### External Authentication Feature

The new **External Authentication** feature contains common functionality used by multiple external (i.e. non-local) authentication providers (like Microsoft or Google login). See [above](#external-authentication-logic-has-been-separated-from-the-users-feature) for details.

### Content Item Shape Alternates Based on Alias and Slug

Content item shapes can be overridden by their alias if `AliasPart` is attached or by their slug if `AutoroutePart` is attached. For examples, refer to the [docs](../reference/modules/Templates/README.md).
